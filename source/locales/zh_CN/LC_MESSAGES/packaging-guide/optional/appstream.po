"AppStream is a cross-distribution effort for providing metadata for "
"software in the (Linux) ecosystem. It provides a convenient way to get "
"information about not installed software, and is one of the building "
"blocks for software centers."

"Desktop environments, file managers, AppImage catalogs, software centers,"
" and app stores can use metadata about the application from inside the "
"AppImage to get a description, URLs, screenshots, and other information "
"that describes the application. This optional metadata travels inside the"
" AppImage."

msgid ""
"So if you would like your application to show a nice screenshot in app "
"centers, you should add an AppStream metainfo file to your AppImage. "
"AppStream is a format that exists independently of AppImage and can be "
"used in conjunction with other packaging formats as well. Many open "
"source applications already come with AppStream metainfo files by "
"default."

"Once you have generated a suitable AppStream metainfo file, place it into"
" :code:`usr/share/metainfo/myapp.appdata.xml` in your AppDir, and "
"generate an AppImage from it. It is generally a good idea to check "
"AppStream metainfo files for errors using the :code:`appstreamcli` and/or"
" :code:`appstream-util` command line tools. :code:`appimagetool` will "
"automatically attempt to validate the AppStream metainfo file if "
":code:`appstreamcli` and/or :code:`appstream-util` are available on the "
":code:`$PATH`."
